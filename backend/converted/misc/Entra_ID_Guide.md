### Entra ID Integration | 1Hybrid Access as a Service

Cloudbrink - MS Entra ID Integration

Cloudbrink's Hybrid Access as a Service has granular role based access controls, enabling administrators to assign different users and groups to needed public and private resources. Rather than requiring customers to manually define these users and groups, Cloudbrink instead integrates with the customerâ€™s existing identity provider. This enables organizations and their end-users to utilize existing single sign-on methods, simplifying onboarding and management. This document covers configuring Cloudbrink with Entra ID.

### Overview

Its key benefits include robust authentication mechanisms, centralized identity man- agement, and simplified access controls. Entra ID facilitates secure and efficient user access, reduc- ing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches. By offering features like multi-factor authen- tication and single sign-on, it greatly improves the user experience while maintaining high security standards.
